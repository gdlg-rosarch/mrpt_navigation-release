Description: This package provides an interface for the mprt (Mobile robotics C++ libraries) and enables the included node to solve a 2D self-localization problem given an existing map. The node is able to use mrpt map formats as well as published ros maps. The interface is similar to the amcl (http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) pkg.
