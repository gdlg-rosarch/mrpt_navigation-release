%description
This package provides an interface for the mprt (Mobile robotics C++ libraries)
and enables the included node to solve a 2D self-localization problem given an
existing map. The node is able to use mrpt map formats as well as published ros
maps. The interface is similar to the amcl (http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) pkg.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
